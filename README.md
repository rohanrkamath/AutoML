# AutoML

This was a project I was placed in during my stay at Asqaured IoT as a Full Stack Developer intern. I was not involved in the model building part of the project. Therefore the 
contents in the "backend" folder is not of my doing (except for tweaking some code for creating hyperparameters and read/write into DB). I have also redacted some files from 
the folder, as told by the company.
