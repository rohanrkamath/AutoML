# AutoML

This was a web app I built during my stay at Asquared IoT as a Full Stack Developer intern. I was not involved in the ML model building part of the project, but built a full tool around the ML code. Therefore the 
contents in the "backend" folder is not of my doing (except for tweaking some code for creating hyperparameters and read/write into DB). I have also redacted some files from 
the folder, as told by the company. 

For more information on the project and my stay here as an intern, visit [my blog](https://rohankamath.me/blog/posts/asquared-iot-experience.html).
